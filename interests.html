  <p>I love video games. I work hard and I play hard.</p>
  <h2>Avengers</h2>
  <p>I'm learning about something I've always been interested in; Data Analytics! I'm hoping that this knowledge will take me to a career I completely enjoy.</p>

  <h2>Harry Potter</h2>
  <p>I love the Harry Potter books. They were a big part of my childhood and developing imagination.</p>
  <h2>Hunger Games</h2>
  <p>I read Hunger Games in my young adult years and I thought the writing was so interesting. The story about how these young teens overcome adversary was very empowering.</p>

  <h2>Video Games</h2>
  <p>Video games are a passion of mine. They have the ability of telling a story and allow you to be immersed or influence the story in your own way. It connects you to its universe emotionally and visually.</p>
  <h2>Working</h2>
  <p>Working to me is one of those things that many people will see as a negative but I see as a positive. I have a drive to be the best at what I do. It may be my competitive or collaborative nature, or maybe I'm just a Capricorn but I love working and creating results.</p>
